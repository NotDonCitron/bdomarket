# BDO Pearl Item Pricing Reference

## Cron Stone Pricing (IMPORTANT!)

### Official Prices:
- **NPC Vendor (Blacksmith):** 3,000,000 silver per Cron Stone
- **Marketplace:** ~2,000,000 - 2,500,000 silver per Cron Stone
  - Varies based on supply/demand
  - Usually 2.0-2.5M range
  - Already 17-33% cheaper than NPC!

### Why Marketplace is Cheaper:
Players can obtain Cron Stones through:
1. **Melting gear** (especially accessories)
2. **Outfit extraction** (this tool's focus)
3. **Boss drops** (occasional)
4. **Events** (temporary)

This creates marketplace supply at prices below NPC vendor cost.

## Valks' Cry Pricing

### Marketplace Only:
- **Marketplace:** ~15,000,000 - 20,000,000 silver
- **No NPC vendor** (marketplace only)
- Price varies significantly based on demand

## Effective Cost Comparison

When you buy a Pearl Item and extract it:

### Example: Premium Outfit at 2.17B
```
Cost: 2,170,000,000 silver
Extraction: 993 Crons + 331 Valks

Effective Cron Cost:
= (2,170,000,000 - 331 Ã— 20,000,000) / 993
= (2,170,000,000 - 6,620,000,000) / 993
= Need to account for Valks value first...

Better calculation:
Total extraction value: 9,103,000,000
Your cost: 2,170,000,000
Savings: 6,933,000,000

If buying same materials:
- 993 Crons @ 2.5M = 2,482,500,000
- 331 Valks @ 20M = 6,620,000,000
- Total: 9,102,500,000

You paid: 2,170,000,000
Effective discount: 76% off marketplace prices!
```

### Bottom Line:
- **NPC Cron:** 3M each (most expensive)
- **Marketplace Cron:** 2-2.5M each (17-33% discount)
- **Extraction Cron:** Effective 1.3-2.2M each (27-55% discount vs NPC)
- **NO TAX:** Extraction bypasses 65.5% marketplace tax

## Why This Tool Matters

Pearl Items on marketplace are:
1. Listed by players who bought with real money
2. Often listed at or near minimum price
3. Instant buy = instant extraction = instant profit
4. Competition is fierce (1-2 second detection required)
5. Success rate: 1-5% due to competition

This tool gives you the **detection speed** to even have a chance.
